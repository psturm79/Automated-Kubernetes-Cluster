# Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring and Reporting
Create a project that sets up a Kubernetes cluster monitoring system with automated reporting. This project will leverage tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and custom scripts to collect metrics, generate alerts, and produce periodic reports.
This project aims to establish a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system for a Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus and Grafana. The system collects and visualizes metrics, generates automated reports, and sends alerts for critical conditions. By deploying Prometheus and Grafana on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on a cloud provider (such as Azure or AWS), and utilizing custom scripts for automation, this project provides an end-to-end solution for monitoring the health and performance of Kubernetes clusters.

# Key Features
* Kubernetes Cluster Setup: Deploy a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider.
* Prometheus Deployment: Monitor cluster metrics using Prometheus.
* Grafana Integration: Visualize metrics with Grafana dashboards.
* Automated Reporting: Generate and distribute periodic reports using custom scripts.
* Alerting System: Configure alerts for critical conditions and integrate with notification services (e.g., Slack, Email).
* Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance.

# Getting Started
1. Set Up Kubernetes Cluster: Follow the instructions in kubernetes/cluster-setup/ to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on your chosen cloud provider.
2. Deploy Prometheus and Grafana: Use the configurations in kubernetes/prometheus/ and kubernetes/grafana/ to deploy monitoring tools.
3. Automate Reporting: Implement and schedule the scripts in scripts/ for automated report generation and alert notifications.
4. Documentation: Refer to docs/ for detailed setup guides and user manuals.
