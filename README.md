# Automated-Kubernetes-Cluster
Create a project that sets up a Kubernetes cluster monitoring system with automated reporting. This project will leverage tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and custom scripts to collect metrics, generate alerts, and produce periodic reports.
This project aims to establish a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system for a Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus and Grafana. The system collects and visualizes metrics, generates automated reports, and sends alerts for critical conditions. By deploying Prometheus and Grafana on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on a cloud provider (such as Azure or AWS), and utilizing custom scripts for automation, this project provides an end-to-end solution for monitoring the health and performance of Kubernetes clusters.
